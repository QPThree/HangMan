A simple hangman game in Python.  

hangman function is passed a word from player 1 to be guessed by player 2.

Player 2 guesses letters until they correct word is spelled out, or the player runs out of guesses and the 'hangman' is completed.

The hangman is stored in a list, which displays an additionaly index (or row) each time player 2 guesses wrong.

    - Create a list of words (or items that need to be studied?) and randomly pass one of them into the function each game.
